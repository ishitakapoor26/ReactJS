package.json: file contains dependencies and scripts required to run the react project.

node_module: includes all the installed dependencies, generated when you run create-ract-app or npm install

public:

manifest.json is for progressive web apps
index.html: this is the only html file which gets served either single or multiple pages application
Since we want react to control the UI, we will not change or add any html code here (exceptions exist).
The div tag with id=root is responsible for controlling or generating entire UI.

src:

index.js : specifies the root component of the app which is App and also specifies the DOM element which is to be controlled by React.
App.js : this file is responsible for the html displayed in the  browser and includes the App component.
App.css : for styling the app component
App.test.js : for unit test
index.css : applies style to the body tag
serviceWorker.js : for progressive web apps

When we run the command npm start, index.html file is served.
index.html contains the root DOM node. Next, the control enters index.js. React component renders the App component onto the root DOM node.
The App component contains the HTML which is ultimately displayed in the browser.
